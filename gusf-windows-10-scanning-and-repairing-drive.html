                            <p> Основная информация о существенных уязвимостях в архитектуре процессоров Intel и AMD (уязвимости Meltdown и Spectre). Список обновлений для всех версий Windows. For the past 2 days my laptop has been having drive issues but it was fine before until a few days ago. Repairing the drive trades 20+ hours and has no sign of fixing it. Is it possible to do a system restore to fix this problem. So for context this launched by itself on startup (it's got the Windows logo and spinning dots too) and fully the message says >Scanning and repairing drive (\\?\SystemPartition): 100% complete It's been saying it's 100% complete for the past half an hour with no changes. Any ideas 
This only occurs when booting to windows 8 (by choosing my windows 8 drive after spamming f12). This doesnt happen when booting to linux (on a second drive) or windows 10 (on a third drive). This problem only started occuring after installing windows 10 on my third drive. Had trouble with my old 500 gb hard drive booting up Windows 10, so I found an old 64 gb SSD I had and wanted to install windows 10 onto it and use it as a boot drive. I got windows 10 onto my flash drive from their site and installed it onto my SSD after deleting all of its partitions. During the installation, it said that my system would have to restart and after doing so, it booted to my SSD and is currently "scanning and repairing drive (D:)". I don't know what would be wrong Took me a long time to get it to install, and it only reverted back to 7. :( it starts scanning and repairing drive c, crashes and then reverts back to 7.very depressing. Do I have any way to disable the scan to make it go through. As some context, I have a crucial 500GB SSD with windows 10 on it and a few of my applications. For everything else I use a 1TB HHD. After a power cut and my pc being shut off suddenly I noticed that every time I booted up the PC it would take an unusual long time to load up windows. After around 2 minutes of the windows loading symbol showing it moves on to say "Scanning and repairing drive (\\?Volume(65db2361-2dfc-47d6-89e9-c2d44af5ece1}): 100% complete. The progress percentage never chang. I was gifted a PC last year from a friend who upgraded, and I have since enjoyed about two awesome hours total on it before something went wrong. Originally I assumed it was something wrong with the HDD, so I put it in a box and didn't touch it until this week. I am inexperienced in PCs but have been trying to diagnose what happened. My PC's main specs are: MSI - FM2-A55M-E33 Micro ATX FM2 Motherboard MSI- GeForce GTX 750 2 GB Twin Frozr Video Card Seagate Barracuda 500GB The problem 
Windows 10 BSOD stop code Memory Management Is there a way to bypass the check disk on Startup? I've gotten BSOD that started a couple weeks ago. I haven't put in any new hardware, upgraded anything, or installed any new software recently. It happened once and I wrote it off, then it happened again and I ran Windows Memory Diagnostic tool. No issues found. I have 2 SSD (one has my OS) and 2 HDD. I don't have a tool to test the SSD, but I ran chkdsk on both my HDD, no disk errors. BSOD return. Hi guys! I'm having a very strange issue in my PC which I left using almost a year ago and started using my second PC but now when I start using my first again the issue arises which is extremely frustrating and time consuming! Issue: It starts as when it goes to starting of windows it takes a lot of time there then it shows the message "Windows is scanning and repairing D: Drive" which goes up-to 10% and here I've two options as either I could press Hello! Recently, the wireless keyboard that was connected to my computer (A Dell Studio XPS 435t with Windows 10 Home) via USB stopped working. I tried replacing the batteries, but it still didn't work. To fix this, I connected an old wired keyboard to the computer, which worked fine. That same day, attempting to log into my user account caused the screen to freeze and return to the clock screen that shows before logging into Windows 10. After a restart, I was able to log into my account. Once again, Private Carl's player was unable to attend our meeting, but luckily another friend of ours was interested in playing, and he played Private Carl well - as you will see. The party chooses to go right towards the airlock labeled "BRIDGE" after clearing the hallway of crawlers, and there they find a command center, corpses, and two androids: Pander and Kranot. They make introductions to the confused bots. They claim to have only booted up 10 minutes ago - an interval they recognize. Almost a week ago, while sitting at a Far Cry 5 DLC loading screen, my game froze and I suddenly got my first ever BSOD with the “unexpected store exception” stop code. I had to force-shutdown the computer because it wouldn’t collect error info and reboot for me; for multiple days after, it tried to repair itself (“scanning and repairing drive (C:)”) and failed (2 or 3 times), I tried to reset it (let it reinstall windows 10 while keeping all my personal stuff) and it failed, I practically. Been meaning to make a post for a while but keep postponing it, hoping the issue would resolve itself however it has not so here I am. Quite frequently when starting my PC and logging in to my account I get a blue screen then have to restart. It can be any of the 9 different errors listed below, some more often than others, some very rare. Almost every single time, a restart will remedy the issue and I'll be able to use my PC without interruptions for the rest of the session. Extremely rarely. I made the mistake of incorrectly shutting down Windows 10 and when I turned it back on it did that Scanning and repairing drive thing. Will rebooting corrupt my current install.

I hadn't played HoTS for a few months and about 2 weeks ago I installed it again to play with friends, since then I've been noticing small I get crashes, freezes, and sometimes BSODs when playing D2 and this has been happening since launch.

Hello there. my laptop is running fine at the moment, but I'm getting some strange issues and today it seems to have gotten worse. I was wondering if someone could help me out, or redirect me somewhere. All the research I've done on it suggests people deleting profiles, but that's not my case at all. I only have one profile on the laptop, and I'm the administrator. The laptop is running Windows 10, usually on the most recent update. It is an Aspire E5-575G. I purchased in in January 2017. Preface: This is my brother's laptop. I am the tech support guy for my house, but am completely stumped here. Yesterday my brother asked for help because Microsoft Office products wouldn't open on his laptop, and the desktop icon names were blurred beyond recognition (all other programs/icons were unaffected). I tried refreshing the desktop (right-click -> refresh) but that did nothing. I then ran a malware scan (just in case), but as I expected nothing showed up. Next I restarted windows. Windows 10 Pro 64-bit, Intel i7 4790k CPU @4GHz, 16GB Ram, Nvidia Geforce GTX 980ti. Drive: Seagate ST3000DM001 My hard drive is dying. Its used as a secondary drive, my OS is on another one. Everything takes forever to open, some stuff doesn't even open at all like chrome and steam. File explorer takes forever to navigate and load. Task Manager says the disk is at 100% usage constantly I've ran Seagate Tools and did couple tests resulting in saying the drive has failed and I should. Started up my fairly high-end desktop yesterday after getting home from work, and I see "Windows is scanning and repairing disk J: I don't have a disk J, I have C, D, E. Even with the recovery partitions and my card reader it only goes up to G. So after its done fucking off it restarts again and now I can't even see any drive except C. My 2 giant HDD's full of Steam games and astrophotography just disappeared. They don't even show up in Disk Management or DiskPart. So after a few more restart. Reposting this from the Bungine Help forums because it got completely ignored there multiple times. I get crashes, freezes, and sometimes BSODs when playing D2 and this has been happening since launch. Its not hardware related since pretty much everything but CPU has changed since launch and there has been no change in how it behaves. There is no rhyme or reason to the crashing and comes at random times doing random activities. I have done everything I can think of which includes. For the past few days I've been trying to solve this problem. To spare everyone some time, I'll give the most important details: -The drive being scanned is NOT my boot drive -The drive is an HDD by Toshiba, 2TB -I have tried reconfiguring BIOS boot settings to no avail -I have tried many ways of trying to reinstall Windows, all of which immediately say "There was an error, Windows could not be reinstalled" -I have tried switching around SATA ports and even cables -The computer boots without.
